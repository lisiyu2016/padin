  <h2>Basics and understanding</h2>
  <p>Here we are describing some basics about the dashboard and explain some definitions. You can connect your projects
    to <strong>pixelplux.com</strong> dashboard for realtime monitoring, artificial intelligence, and reporting.
    We provide scalable and relaible platform for Iot projects which can be used for vast variety of purposes.
  </p>

  <h2>Integrating projects and softwares</h2>
  <p>We are trying to provide couple of methods that gives developers this ability to conenct their projects to dashboard.
    These methods are consisting:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><a routerLink="/docs/restful-api">RESTful api for biodirectional information, such as temperature projects</a></li>
    <li>UDP api for biodirectional information, such as temperature projects</li>
    <li>MQTT api, for multidirectional communications, such as sending information and recieving orders</li>
  </ul>

  <strong>Note: </strong> <i>UDP and MQTT are still in experimental area, so they are not available in production and their
  api and domain access might change in near future.</i>

  
  <h2>Getting a token</h2>
  <p>You can find your <a routerLink="/token">Access Token</a> inside your settings section. Make sure you use the <a routerLink="/token">Access Token</a> only to update us for your project information,
  such as the changes in temperature or humidity, projects usages and etc. There might be other tokens provided to you
  and each have their own usage.
  Eversince you have your token, you can make post and get requests to the api server included <strong>x-token</strong> in headers.</p>

  <h2>CloudProject vs DataSource</h2>
  <p>We have two definition in dashboard for data and projects which are really simple to understand and straightforward.</p>

  <p><b>CloudProject</b> is a project that you can create in your management dashboard, in your Projects > Create a project. This project
  represents a phyical project or a part of that, and main purpose is to be used for human interactions, drawing charts and making reports.
  Each project, has a datasource. This datasource, is a raw data, such as a number for temperature that you send to api
  from your project. All projects must be connected to a datasource inorder to collect information.
  </p>
  <p>When you send your data with a data source id, we collect it, but if there is no project for this API we will show it in
    projects pages, as unconnected project. We are not subject to hold these information for long, if there is no project assigned.
    So it's necessary to create project based on project as quick as possible.

  </p>
  <p>You can connect a datasource to many projects only for biodirectional projects. We don't know why you might use this,
    but it's available in case of any usages.
  </p>
